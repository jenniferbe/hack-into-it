Also, since shes not a high school grad, you nor her can get any of the three education credits. Since shes claimed as a dependent on your return (and has to be for the child support) she cant claim the tuition credit either. Bummer. Its just all out-of-pocket and doesnt help your daughter on her taxes. <br/>My suggestion would be to claim nothing this year. Dont even report education expenses at all. Since a college student or the person claiming them can only get the education credits for a maximum of four years, and the amount of the credit is directly tied to the out-of-pocket qualified education expenses paid, youll probably be better off in the long run if you save that credit deduction for when she finishes HS and is truely a full time college student. <br/>Also, if she graduates in 2013 or 2014 it is &quot;extremely&quot; important that she file for her FAFSA&nbsp;&nbsp;(Financila Assistance/Financial Student Aid) prior to March 1st. In her/your situation, Ive no doubt youll qualify for TONS of tax free/tax exempt support. You and her will do that on-line at <a href=http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ rel=nofollow target=_blank>http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a> The sooner you do this, the better. <br/>Also, google for &quot;schollarships&quot; as well as &quot;schollarships disabled&quot; and stuff. Finally, is there any connection to the military with your daughter? I ask, because Im a retired vet, and got a &quot;big&quot; help from different military aid societies with putting my two kids through college. Couldnt have done it otherwise, without taking out student loans. Happy to say Ive got one through college and &quot;almost&quot; the second one, without one penny of debt in the process. Though I am getting tired of eating rice and beans every night. :)<br/>&nbsp;I just, quite accidently, came across a website with all kinds of schollarships for Texas folks.

The only objective is profit, and nothing else. No college recruiter is trying to &quot;help&quot; you. Hes trying to earn his paycheck. He doesnt care about your disability, so long as he gets paid and can feed his own family. The job of a college recruiter is to find students and provide a source of income for the college. The job of a &quot;college employed&quot; student or education counseler, is to &quot;keep&quot; students that provide a source of income, enrolled at &quot;that&quot; school. <br/>Bottom line is, youll probably get more sound assistance from a high school counselor, who has nothing to gain or lose if the student stays in school or drops out. Also, if she does&nbsp;&nbsp;intern work, she can get lots of knowlege from those she works with, so more sound educational decisions can be made based on a wider horizon of experiences and information.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing I like to stress though is &quot;NO STUDENT LOANS&quot;. Otherwise, you spend the first 20 plus years after graduation working to pay of loans that are NOT bankruptable. I myself am on a rice and beans diet for other year, until my son graduates. There was a year in there when my kids were in college at the same time. Daughter was in last year, son in his first year. That year, my rice and beans diet was rice only. But I made it by the skin of my teeth without any loans. BTW - if you have a 401(k), IRA or some other ritrement account, you CAN take money out of it for reasons of disability.
